# How to view the comparison

Yesterday I start to practise writing on github, but I found there was something strange of taking review of the comparison. It was taken by a whole block view, but not by each word view. Td, so today I will find the right way to use the feature.
(This made me puzzled,)
For test:  

`This string is a test sentence which will be changed for some times later. Now I make a change on this string:)`

When I commit this article, then I will come back to make some change on the test string to take a commit again. 
At last I will get into the 'history' view and take the comparison view of the lastest two commits.

So let's do it and fgure it out.
Oh! I got it. Now I will make a short summary to the steps...

### The right way to use the comparison function:
1. Writing a new doc with 'create a new file' button, when you finish it, take a 'commit';
2. When you want to make some changes to the previous doc, you'd enter the 'master' branch, and click the doc file, then click the 'edit';
3. Finishing the changes and then commit as usual;
4. If you want to check the comparison of these two commits, click the doc file and then click the 'history' to enter a view;
5. Clicking the commit serial number of the latest commit, then you will be there for the comparison view;
6. (I suggest you to select the 'unified' view, it will be clearer than the 'split' view in my personal perspective.)

Look at it, it's very beautiful and clear, isn't it?

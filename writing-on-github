# The first article on my github
Today I suddenly realized that there is a very useful feature on github which can help me to practising my writing skill, both in Chinese and English.
Becuase on github, it has a version controlling function that can show the differences between your submissions, it likes a natural comparer for me.
The most import thing for writing practising and rethinking is to review, to check, and to adjust it. So the first thing you should do is to record,
to write down your thinking process. Secondly, you should review your thinking for several times periodically, through that you can realiazed the lack your thinking before and adjust them.
Finnally, your perspective about one thing will be improved more and more deeply through these cycle above.
So, it is a very important thing that finding out efficient tools to help you. Surely, github is a free, efficient, powerful tool, for developers, and for writers now.
